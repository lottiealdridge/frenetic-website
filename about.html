             <p class="mt-5 mb-5">Frenetic’s focus has always been on the art of DJing—crafting moments that resonate long after the music stops and proving that true longevity in this scene comes from the connection with the crowd. She understands the raw, unfiltered energy of a rave and how to guide a crowd to places they didn’t know existed, connecting eras and sub-genres with a savage blend of technicality and entertainment. A deeply versatile artist, Frenetic is one of the few DJs to have been invited to showcase her skills on BBC Radio 1’s Drum & Bass Show with both the D&B Mix and the Chilled D&B Mix. She has earned respect from some of the scene’s veteran players, having played at iconic XOYO residencies curated by Randall, S.P.Y, and Danny Byrd, as well as events selected by Jumpin' Jack Frost, A.M.C, and Dillinja's legendary Valve Soundsystem.
         Whether playing at major events like Hospitality, Boomtown, or Nozstock, or headlining the underground raves that form the backbone of the scene, Frenetic brings the same explosive dynamism and wild drops that have made her a force to be reckoned with.
         With a name that’s quickly gaining recognition internationally, her electrifying sets have already taken her to clubs and festivals across Europe, with performances in Germany, Belgium, France, Albania, Austria, and Croatia.</p>
